## Current Status

> **Esteladac:** This project is currently on hold ‚Äî I'll be back to it soon! In the meantime, feel free to explore my other repositories where I'm actively working on new ideas.

---

Let me know if you'd like it more casual, technical, or translated into another language.


**ESPAura** is a modular, personal Ambilight firmware built for ESP8266-based microcontrollers (like the D1 Mini), designed and developed by **Esteladac** for a custom LED setup. It enables LED screen backlighting via the Adalight protocol and allows for customizable LED settings.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is currently in development for a final product that will be sold.**  
> The code is strictly **private** and **should not be used or redistributed** under any circumstances by anyone who does not have explicit, written, and signed permission from **Esteladac**.

> üîß **The code of [this repository](https://github.com/esteladac/ambilight_firmware) is currently being rewritten under this repository.**  
> Updates will be available **before June 2025**.

> üì¨ If someone has forked or modified the code and wishes to make it public, it may be allowed after a full review and approval by Esteladac. Publication can only happen on the main branch of this repository or in an officially acknowledged annex (with explicit written consent).

> üß™ This code will be open-sourced once completed and tested with most compatible hardware setups.

## üö´ What This Is **Not**

- ‚ùå A public project or general-purpose firmware  
- ‚ùå Maintained with issue support or PR review  
- ‚ùå Compatible with all setups ‚Äì it is **hardware-specific**
