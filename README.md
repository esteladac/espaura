**ESPAura** is a modular, personal Ambilight firmware built for ESP8266-based microcontrollers (like the D1 Mini), designed and developed by **Esteladac** for a custom LED setup. It enables LED screen backlighting via the Adalight protocol and allows for customizable LED settings, but is tailored specifically to **Esteladac's** hardware.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is currently in development for a final product that will be sold.**  
> The code is strictly **private** and **should not be used or redistributed** under any circumstances by anyone who does not have explicit, written, and signed permission from **Esteladac**.

> üîß **The code of [this repository](https://github.com/esteladac/ambilight_firmware) is currently being rewrited under this repository.**  
> Updates will be available **before June 2025**.
